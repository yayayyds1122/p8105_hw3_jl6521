## Problem 1

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
size = nrow(ny_noaa)
column = ncol(ny_noaa)
cleaned_noaa = ny_noaa %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year","month","day"), sep="-") 
```

Description of the dataset: the dataset consists of records from 2595176
weather stations around the world with 7 daily variables. They are ids,
maximum and minimum temperature, total daily precipitation, snowfall,
and snow depth.

\*and indicating the extent to which missing data is an issue. \##
Problem 2

Number of Men and Women by Education Category

``` r

  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +

Comment: From the plot, we can see that the age of the people with more
than high school degree is usually lower than the other two education
levels. The age of males and females are similar for both less than high
school group and more than high school group, but not the high school
equivalent group. In the high school equivalent group, the age of
females is higher htan the males.

``` r
agg_data =

Comment: \* For the less than high school group, the total activity of
males and females decrease as age increase, except for a peak around age
60 when the total activities of two group increase from 45 to 60. Before
40 years old, the total activity of females are larger than of males,
but after 40 years old, total activities for males are larger than
females. \* For the high school equivalent group, the total activity
increase at first when age is small and then decreases as females and
male get older. For females, there’s an small increase again at later
age but not for males. Generally females have higher total activity than
males except for the initial time. \* For the more than high school
group, the total activity of females is larger than the males all the
time.

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education', 'sex'. You can override using

Description: the dataset records the ride ID, ride type, the day of the
ride, duration of the ride, start and end station time, and also if it’s
citi bike member or casual riders.
